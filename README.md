SDLC SUMMARY

This Student Management System was developed using HTML following the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). The system requirements were analyzed to collect and display student information. The interface was designed using HTML forms and tables, and the system was implemented using HTML only. It was tested in a web browser to ensure proper functionality, deployed by hosting the HTML file on GitHub, and can be maintained by adding CSS and JavaScript for future improvements
